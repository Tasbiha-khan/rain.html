        <h1>Facts About Rainwater Harvesting</h1>
        <span>Rainwater harvesting is one of the most effective and sustainable methods of water conservation. Below are important and interesting facts that highlight its value for homes, communities, and the environment.</span>
        <h2>Global Water Facts</h2>
        <p>Only about 2.5% of the Earth’s water is freshwater, and less than 1% is easily accessible for human use.
           Water scarcity affects billions of people worldwide, making conservation essential.
           Rainwater is a free and natural resource that falls directly on rooftops and land surfaces.</p>
           <h2>Collection & Storage Facts</h2>
           <p>A 1,000 square foot roof can collect thousands of liters of water annually, depending on rainfall.
              Even small rain events can provide a significant amount of reusable water.
              Rainwater harvesting systems can be installed in both urban and rural areas.
              Collected rainwater can be stored in tanks, barrels, or underground reservoirs.</p>
           <h2>Household Benefits</h2>
           <p>Rainwater can reduce household water bills by 30–50%, depending on usage.
              It is ideal for gardening, washing cars, cleaning, and flushing toilets.
              Properly filtered rainwater can also be used for drinking in some regions.
              Systems require low maintenance when properly installed..</p>
           <h2>Environmental Benefits</h2>
           <p>Helps recharge groundwater levels.
              Reduces urban flooding and stormwater runoff.
              Minimizes soil erosion.
              Supports sustainable water management practices.
              Reduces pressure on municipal water supplies.</p>

    <h3>Methods Of Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
    <p>Rainwater harvesting is a sustainable practice of collecting and storing rainwater for future use. This practice reduces reliance on main water supplies and helps manage stormwater runoff. Here are the primary methods used</p>

      <div class="m2">
         <h4>Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting</h4>
         <p>This is the most common method for residential and commercial buildings. Rainwater is collected from the roof surface and directed through gutters and downspouts into a storage tank.Components: Catchment area (roof), transportation (pipes/gutters), first-flush diverter (to remove debris), and storage (tanks or barrels).Use: Irrigation, flushing toilets, laundry, and—if properly filtered—drinking.</p>

      <div class="m2">
         <h4>Surface Runoff Harvesting</h4>
         <p>In urban and rural areas, rainwater that flows along the ground can be collected. This involves creating infrastructure to catch water from paved surfaces, parks, or open fields.Methods: Ponds, reservoirs, or underground tanks.Use: Primarily for landscaping, agriculture, and recharging groundwater.</p>

         <h4>Groundwater Recharge</h4>
         <p>Instead of storing water in tanks, this method directs rainwater back into the ground to replenish aquifers. This is crucial in areas where groundwater levels are depleting.Techniques:Recharge Pits: Small pits filled with pebbles and sand that allow water to seep into the ground.Borewells: Directing filtered rainwater into existing or abandoned wells.Soak Trenches: Long, narrow trenches filled with filter media.</p>

         <h4>Recharge Pit method</h4>
         <p>The Recharge Pit method is a highly effective technique for replenishing groundwater levels. Unlike storage tanks that hold water for surface use, recharge pits direct rainwater into the subsurface aquifers.</p>
