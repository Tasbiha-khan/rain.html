                <h4>Individual Houses</h4>
                <p>Individual or single houses are independent residential units designed for one family. These homes
                    usually have their own rooftop, garden space, and water supply system, which makes them highly
                    suitable for installing a rainwater harvesting system. Because the roof area directly collects
                    rainwater, it becomes easy to channel the water through gutters and pipes into a storage tank.In
                    single houses, harvested rainwater can be effectively used for gardening, lawn irrigation, car
                    washing, cleaning outdoor areas, and toilet flushing. With proper filtration, it can also be used
                    for other non-drinking indoor purposes. Installing a small to medium-sized storage tank is usually
                    sufficient for a single-family home, depending on the roof size and rainfall in the area.Rainwater
                    harvesting in individual houses helps reduce water bills, decreases dependence on groundwater, and
                    supports environmentally friendly living. It is a cost-effective and practical solution that allows
                    homeowners to manage water resources responsibly while contributing to long-term sustainability.</p>

                <h4>Apartments / Flats</h4>
                <p>Apartments or flats are multi-story residential buildings where multiple families live within
                    separate housing units. Due to their large rooftop areas and high water demand, apartments are
                    highly suitable for centralized rainwater harvesting systems. Rainwater collected from the rooftop
                    can be directed through a network of pipes into a shared underground or overhead storage tank.In
                    apartment buildings, harvested rainwater is commonly used for toilet flushing, floor cleaning,
                    gardening, parking area washing, and other maintenance purposes. Since water consumption is higher
                    in such buildings, installing a proper filtration system and large-capacity storage tank is
                    essential to ensure efficient and safe use.Rainwater harvesting in apartments significantly reduces
                    dependence on municipal water supply and groundwater sources. It also lowers overall water expenses
                    for residents and helps manage stormwater runoff, reducing the risk of urban flooding. By adopting
                    rainwater harvesting systems, apartment communities can promote sustainable living while ensuring
                    long-term water security.</p>

                <h4>Gated Communities & Housing Colonies</h4>
                <p>In gated communities, rainwater can be collected from multiple rooftops and directed into centralized
                    underground storage tanks or groundwater recharge pits. This system allows the entire community to
                    benefit from a shared water resource. Harvested rainwater can be effectively used for landscaping,
                    park irrigation, street cleaning, car washing areas, and toilet flushing in shared
                    facilities.Installing rainwater harvesting systems in housing colonies not only reduces dependence
                    on municipal water supply but also helps control urban flooding by managing stormwater runoff.
                    Groundwater recharge systems are especially beneficial in large colonies, as they help restore
                    declining water tables.By implementing a well-planned rainwater harvesting system, gated communities
                    can promote sustainable living, reduce water expenses for residents, and contribute to long-term
                    environmental protection. It is a smart and responsible solution for modern residential
                    developments.</p>

                <h4>Shopping Malls & Retail Centers</h4>
                <p>Retail centers and shopping malls represent a high-stakes category in rainwater harvesting due to
                    their massive structural footprint and significant water demand. These facilities typically feature
                    vast, impervious surfaces—both in the form of expansive rooftops and sprawling asphalt parking
                    lots—which generate enormous volumes of runoff during storm events. Without a sophisticated
                    harvesting system, this water would overwhelm municipal drainage, leading to local flash flooding.
                    To mitigate this, modern retail developments utilize "Dual-Purpose Catchment" strategies: clean
                    water is harvested from the rooftops for direct indoor reuse, while more contaminated runoff from
                    parking areas is directed through oil and grit separators before being used for landscaping or
                    groundwater replenishment.The infrastructure required for a mall is significantly more complex than
                    a residential setup. It often involves siphonic drainage systems that can handle high-velocity water
                    flow and large-scale filtration units to ensure the water is safe for non-potable applications. One
                    of the most common applications in this category is supplying water to HVAC cooling towers; because
                    rainwater is naturally soft and low in mineral content, it helps prevent the scale buildup that
                    typically plagues industrial machinery. Additionally, harvested water is integrated into the
                    building’s plumbing to handle the constant demand for toilet and urinal flushing, which accounts for
                    the majority of a mall's daily water consumption.</p>

                <h4>Office Buildings</h4>
                <p>Office buildings consume a significant amount of water daily for washrooms, cleaning, landscaping, and maintenance. Because most office complexes have large rooftops and paved surroundings, they are highly suitable for installing rainwater harvesting systems. These systems help collect, store, and reuse rainwater efficiently for non-drinking purposes.The collected water is directed through pipes into storage tanks, where it is filtered and stored for later use. In office buildings, harvested rainwater can be used for toilet flushing, landscape irrigation, cleaning, and cooling systems, which helps reduce dependence on municipal water supply. This not only lowers water bills but also promotes environmental sustainability by conserving freshwater resources and reducing stormwater runoff. Implementing rainwater harvesting systems in office buildings supports green building practices and contributes to a more eco-friendly and cost-effective infrastructure.</p>

                <h4>Industrial & Warehouse Buildings</h4>
                <p>Industrial and warehouse buildings are highly suitable for rainwater harvesting due to their expansive roof surfaces, which can capture large volumes of rainwater efficiently. The collected rainwater is channeled through gutters and pipes into filtration systems and large storage tanks. In industrial settings, harvested rainwater can be used for machinery cooling, cleaning processes, toilet flushing, landscaping, and even certain manufacturing operations where potable water is not required. This practice significantly reduces operational water costs, decreases pressure on municipal water supplies, and helps manage stormwater runoff. By integrating rainwater harvesting systems, industrial and warehouse facilities can enhance sustainability, improve environmental compliance, and support eco-friendly industrial development.</p>
