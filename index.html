            <p>Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting and storing rainwater for future use instead of allowing it to run off. It is a simple, cost-effective, and sustainable solution to reduce dependence on traditional water sources and conserve groundwater by capturing rainwater from rooftops and other surfaces, rainwater harvesting systems help communities, homes, and businesses make better use of natural rainfall Rainwater harvesting is an effective step toward water security and environmental responsibility. Whether used in residential, commercial, or industrial settings, it supports long-term sustainability and smarter water management Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting, storing, and using rainwater for various purposes instead of allowing it to run off as waste. It is an effective and eco-friendly method to conserve water and recharge groundwater levels Water scarcity is a growing global problem due to population growth, urbanization, and climate change. Rainwater harvesting helps reduce dependence on traditional water sources like rivers and groundwater. It also minimizes water shortages during dry seasons and helps maintain the natural water cycle Rainwater harvesting is a simple yet powerful solution to address water scarcity. By adopting this practice at individual, community, and national levels, we can ensure water security for future generations and protect the environment</p>

            <p>Rainwater is collected from a catchment area such as a roof, directed through gutters and pipes, filtered to remove debris, and stored in tanks or recharge systems. The stored water can then be used for various non-potable and potable purposes, depending on treatment Rainwater harvesting is an effective step toward water security and environmental responsibility. Whether used in residential, commercial, or industrial settings, it supports long-term sustainability and smarter water management The rapid growth of population, industrialization, and urban development has led to excessive use of groundwater. As a result, water tables are falling, wells are drying up, and many regions face acute water shortages. Rainwater harvesting helps overcome these problems by efficiently utilizing the rainwater that would otherwise be wasted </p>
