                <h3>Rainwater Harvesting System</h3>
                <p>Rooftop rainwater harvesting is a technique in which rainwater falling on the roof of a building is
                    collected, filtered, and stored for future use.This method
                    is commonly used in residential and commercial buildings because it is simple,
                    and cost-effective rainwater falling on the rooftop of a building is collected through gutters and
                    conveyance pipes and then passed through a treatment system to remove impurities. After filtration,
                    the water is stored in a subsurface storage tank where it is kept safe for future use. A pump is
                    used to lift the stored water for usage or transfer it to an elevated storage tank. This system is
                    widely used in residential and commercial buildings as it helps in conserving water, reducing water
                    bills, and recharging groundwater in an eco-friendly manner Rooftop rainwater harvesting system
                    plays an important role in water conservation by efficiently collecting rainwater from the roof
                    surface of buildings. The pitched rooftop allows rainwater to flow naturally towards the gutters,
                    from where it is carried through pipes to a filtration or treatment unit. This treatment system
                    removes dust, leaves, and other impurities, ensuring cleaner water before storage.</p>

                <h3>Surface Runoff Harvesting</h3>
                <p>Surface runoff harvesting is a rainwater harvesting technique in which rainwater flowing over the land surface after rainfall is collected and stored for future use. During heavy rains, water that does not seep into the ground moves as runoff and is directed through channels or drains into ponds, tanks, reservoirs, or recharge structures. This method is especially useful in open areas where large amounts of rainwater can be captured efficiently.This technique helps in reducing water wastage and prevents soil erosion and flooding caused by excessive surface runoff. Surface runoff harvesting is commonly used in agricultural fields, parks, roadsides, and open grounds. The stored water can be used for irrigation, gardening, and groundwater recharge, making it an effective and sustainable method for water conservation.Natural slopes of land are used to guide rainwater into collection systems such as channels, drains, and catchment areas. These systems then divert the water into storage structures like ponds, tanks, or artificial lakes for later use.Natural slopes of land are used to guide rainwater into collection systems such as channels, drains, and catchment areas.

                <h3>Recharge Pit Method</h3>
                <p>Recharge pit method is a rainwater harvesting technique in which rainwater is collected and allowed to percolate into the ground through specially constructed pits. These pits are usually filled with layers of gravel, sand, and stones that help filter the water before it reaches the underground aquifers. This process improves the quality and quantity of groundwater in the area.Recharge pits are commonly constructed in residential colonies, parks, and open spaces where natural groundwater recharge is low due to concrete surfaces. The rainwater collected from rooftops or surface runoff is diverted into these pits through pipes or drains. This method helps prevent waterlogging and ensures effective utilization of rainwater.The recharge pit method is cost-effective, easy to maintain, and environmentally friendly. It plays a significant role in restoring declining groundwater levels and supports sustainable water management practices, especially in urban areas facing water scarcity.</p>

                <h3>Percolation pit technique</h3>
                <p>Percolation pit technique is a rainwater harvesting method in which rainwater is allowed to slowly seep into the ground through specially constructed pits. These pits are usually filled with layers of sand, gravel, and stones that help filter the water before it percolates into the soil. This technique is mainly used to recharge groundwater and improve underground water levels.Percolation pits are commonly constructed in open areas, parks, gardens, and rural regions where the soil has good infiltration capacity. Rainwater collected from rooftops or surface runoff is directed into these pits, allowing the water to move gradually into deeper soil layers. This method reduces surface runoff, prevents waterlogging, and supports sustainable groundwater management.Rainwater collected from rooftops, open areas, or surface runoff is directed into the pit, where it slowly percolates through the soil. This natural filtration process helps remove impurities before the water reaches underground aquifers.</p>

            <h3>Residential Area</h3>
            <img src="assets/img1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Rainwater harvesting in residential areas focuses on collecting and storing rainwater from rooftops of houses and apartments. The collected rainwater is directed through gutters and pipes into storage tanks or recharge pits. This water can be used for household purposes such as gardening, toilet flushing, cleaning, and groundwater recharge. Residential rainwater harvesting systems are cost-effective, easy to maintain, and help reduce dependency on municipal water supply.These systems are especially useful in urban areas where groundwater levels are declining. By installing rooftop collection systems and recharge pits, households can conserve water, reduce water bills, and contribute to environmental sustainability.</p>

            <h3>Commercial Area</h3>
            <img src="assets/img1.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Rainwater harvesting in commercial areas involves the collection and storage of rainwater from large rooftops such as offices, shopping malls, hospitals, schools, and factories. Due to the large roof surface, commercial buildings can collect a significant amount of rainwater. This water is stored in large above-ground or underground tanks and is commonly used for toilet flushing, cleaning, landscaping, cooling systems, and fire safety purposes. Commercial rainwater harvesting systems help reduce water bills, lower dependency on municipal water supply, and promote sustainable water management</p>
